# Foundation verification — 2026-11-03

Eight unittest cases passed, including an actual SDK stdio client/server session. Tests verify tool discovery, snapshot inspection, invalid ID rejection, hash tampering, explicit identity boundaries, freshness metadata and basic ingestion rejection. They do not prove live game compatibility or complete schema validation.

Review found non-atomic publication; replaced direct writes with same-directory temporary file, flush/fsync and atomic replacement. Concurrent publication still requires a dedicated regression test.

Jev advisory: resolved jev-1.14.0; request eab70f0a806d20d38bfe60cbd01399a0ef5b6e8b9de52f1cfcc6b7682f5fe406; input/output tokens 867/131; elapsed 0.434s. Evidence sufficiency 0.39, material issue 0.21, full completion unsupported 0.93. Disposition: foundation increment only; no completion/release claim. Initial review request had an invalid focus enum and was corrected.

Required adversarial-review file was absent at the supplied path. Performance skill path was unavailable. No benchmark or optimisation claim made.
