# Azeroth Operator

Local character analysis and player-operated configuration tools for World of Warcraft.

## Client subdivisions

- `clients/retail/`: Retail adapter, addon and capability evidence.
- `clients/classic/`: Classic adapter, addon and capability evidence. Classic variants must be identified explicitly; Era and progression clients are not interchangeable.
- `clients/forever/`: Forever adapter, addon and capability evidence.
- `shared/`: client-independent snapshot contracts, policy enforcement and planning.
- `mcp/`: shared MCP interface, requiring an explicit client identity.
- `tests/`: shared tests and separate client qualification suites.

Status: project structure and scope only. No addon or MCP implementation has been qualified yet.

## Boundaries

Read ordinary addon exports and official API data; analyse and prepare player-reviewed imports. No autonomous gameplay, computer use, memory access, injection, packet interception, protected-action bypasses or arbitrary Lua execution. In-game writes remain disabled pending operation-specific policy review and client verification. A callable API is not proof of Blizzard authorisation.

No character data, account identifiers, credentials or local exports belong in Git.

## Verification

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` from the project root. Structural checks do not establish runtime game compatibility.
